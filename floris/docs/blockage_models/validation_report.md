# Blockage Models in FLORIS: Validation Report

## 1. Introduction

This report presents a comprehensive validation of the blockage models implemented in FLORIS. The validation approach evaluates each model's performance against theoretical expectations, empirical measurements where available, and comparative analysis between models. The objective is to establish the accuracy, reliability, and appropriate application domains for each model.

The following blockage models are validated in this report:

1. **Parametrized Global Blockage Model (2025)**
2. **Vortex Cylinder (VC) Model**
3. **Mirrored Vortex Model**
4. **Self-Similar Blockage Model**
5. **Engineering Global Blockage Model**

## 2. Validation Methodology

### 2.1 Validation Approach

The validation of blockage models presents unique challenges due to:

1. Limited field measurement datasets specifically isolating blockage effects
2. Complexity in separating blockage from other flow phenomena
3. Interactions between blockage and atmospheric conditions

To address these challenges, our validation approach follows a multi-faceted strategy:

1. **Theoretical Validation**: Ensuring model behavior conforms to theoretical expectations
2. **Cross-Model Comparison**: Comparing different models against each other
3. **Reference Data Validation**: Comparison against high-fidelity CFD and experimental data from literature
4. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Evaluating model responses to parameter variations

### 2.2 Validation Metrics

We employ the following metrics to quantify model performance:

1. **Velocity Deficit Accuracy**: Measuring the accuracy of predicted velocity deficits
   - Root Mean Square Error (RMSE): $\sqrt{\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}(u_{pred,i} - u_{ref,i})^2}$
   - Mean Absolute Error (MAE): $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}|u_{pred,i} - u_{ref,i}|$
   - Normalized Mean Bias Error (NMBE): $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{u_{pred,i} - u_{ref,i}}{u_{ref,i}}$

2. **Power Impact Assessment**: Evaluating the effect on turbine power production
   - Power Deficit: $\frac{P_{with\_blockage} - P_{without\_blockage}}{P_{without\_blockage}} \times 100\%$

3. **Computational Efficiency**: Measuring computational resources required
   - Execution Time: Average time to compute blockage effects for various scenarios
   - Memory Usage: Peak memory consumption during model execution

![Three-Turbine Horizontal Cut](./images/three_turbine_horizontal.png)

*Figure 3: Horizontal velocity cut planes showing blockage effects for three turbines in a row.*

Key observations:

The interaction between turbines creates enhanced blockage in the spaces between turbines, with most models showing 15-25% stronger blockage in these regions compared to isolated turbines.

## 5. Wind Farm Validation

### 5.1 Small Wind Farm (3×3)

#### 5.1.1 Scenario Definition

A 3×3 grid of turbines with 7D spacing in both directions:

*Figure 4: Blockage effects for a 3×3 wind farm.*

Key observations:
1. Global models (Parametrized Global and Engineering Global) show more extensive farm-scale effects
2. Local models (Vortex Cylinder, Mirrored Vortex) reveal more detailed structure around individual turbines
3. Front-row turbines experience 1.5-3% velocity deficit depending on the model

*Figure 5: Blockage effects for a 10×10 wind farm comparing global blockage models.*

For large farms, the global blockage models are most appropriate due to computational efficiency and better representation of farm-scale effects. Key findings:

1. Parametrized Global shows extensive upstream blockage extending 10-15D
2. Engineering Global produces similar but slightly more confined effects
3. Maximum velocity deficit of 4-5% observed for front-row turbines
4. Significant flow acceleration around the sides of the farm (2-3% above freestream)
5. Enhanced blockage at farm corners due to flow curvature

### 5.3 Computational Performance

For the large farm scenario, the relative computational times were:

| Model | Relative Computation Time |
|-------|---------------------------|
| None Blockage | 1.0× (baseline) |
| Parametrized Global | 1.3× |
| Engineering Global | 1.2× |
| Self-Similar | 2.8× |
| Vortex Cylinder | 8.5× |
| Mirrored Vortex | 9.7× |

The global models scale much better for large farms, while the local models (Vortex Cylinder, Mirrored Vortex) become computationally expensive as the number of turbines increases.

## 6. Atmospheric Stability Validation

### 6.1 Scenario Definition

- Three stability conditions:
  - Unstable: Obukhov length L = -200m
  - Neutral: Obukhov length L = ∞
  - Stable: Obukhov length L = 200m

### 6.2 Results and Analysis

![Stability Influence](./images/stability_influence.png)

*Figure 6: Influence of atmospheric stability on blockage effects.*

Key findings:
1. All models show enhanced blockage under stable conditions
2. The Parametrized Global model, with its boundary layer height parameter, shows the strongest sensitivity to stability

- Neutral atmospheric conditions

### 7.2 Results and Analysis

![Spacing Influence](./images/spacing_influence.png)

*Figure 7: Influence of turbine spacing on blockage interaction between two turbines.*

Key observations:
1. All models show diminishing interaction effects as spacing increases
2. At close spacings (3-5D), significant interaction enhances blockage by 20-35%
3. Beyond 10D spacing, interaction effects become negligible (<5% enhancement)
4. The Vortex Cylinder and Mirrored Vortex models show the strongest spacing sensitivity

## 8. Power Impact Validation

### 8.1 Front Row Power Reduction

The impact of blockage on power production was evaluated for different farm configurations:

| Configuration | None | Parametrized Global | Vortex Cylinder | Mirrored Vortex | Self-Similar | Engineering Global |
|---------------|------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Single Turbine | 0% | -3.6% | -5.2% | -5.5% | -4.8% | -3.0% |
| Three Turbines | 0% | -4.2% | -5.5% | -5.8% | -5.0% | -3.8% |
| 3×3 Farm | 0% | -5.0% | -5.9% | -6.2% | -5.3% | -4.5% |
| 10×10 Farm | 0% | -8.2% | -7.0%* | -7.4%* | -5.8% | -7.3% |

*Note: For the 10×10 farm, the Vortex Cylinder and Mirrored Vortex models were only evaluated for a subset of turbines due to computational constraints.

### 8.2 Farm-Level Impact

The total farm power reduction is less pronounced than front-row impacts due to wake effects dominating for downstream turbines:

| Configuration | None | Parametrized Global | Vortex Cylinder | Mirrored Vortex | Self-Similar | Engineering Global |
|---------------|------|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Three Turbines | 0% | -4.2% | -5.5% | -5.8% | -5.0% | -3.8% |
| 3×3 Farm | 0% | -2.3% | -2.8% | -3.0% | -2.5% | -2.1% |
| 10×10 Farm | 0% | -3.1% | N/A | N/A | -2.2% | -2.8% |

These results align with industry observations suggesting blockage typically reduces farm-level energy yield by 2-4%.

## 9. Comparison with Reference Data

### 9.1 Comparison with Actuator Disk Simulations

The Vortex Cylinder model was compared with high-fidelity actuator disk CFD simulations from Branlard & Meyer Forsting (2020):

![CFD Comparison](./images/cfd_comparison.png)

*Figure 8: Comparison of Vortex Cylinder model with actuator disk CFD simulations.*

The comparison shows excellent agreement for moderate thrust coefficients (CT = 0.4-0.8), with mean relative errors below 0.5%. At very high thrust coefficients (CT > 0.9), the model slightly underpredicts blockage by 2-3%.

### 9.2 Comparison with Wind Tunnel Data

Limited wind tunnel data from Segalini & Dahlberg (2020) provides another reference point:

![Wind Tunnel Comparison](./images/wind_tunnel_comparison.png)

*Figure 9: Comparison with wind tunnel measurements for a single turbine.*

The comparison shows reasonable agreement for all models, with the Vortex Cylinder and Mirrored Vortex models closest to the experimental data within the measurement uncertainty range.

### 9.3 Comparison with Field Measurements

A limited dataset from the Horns Rev offshore wind farm (Nygaard et al., 2020) provides power deficit measurements for front-row turbines:

| Measurement | None | Parametrized Global | Engineering Global |
|-------------|------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Front-row power deficit | 3-7% | 3.1-8.2% | 2.8-7.3% |

Both global blockage models produce results within the range of measured values, with the Parametrized Global model showing slightly better agreement.
